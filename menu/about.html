            Born after 2000 years for me, the world's greatest influence on our generation is technology, our lives are
        filled with the shadow of technology. Computers have taken up residence in the technology of our culture. In the
        article "Screen Record", the author points out that the changes computer technology is making in our lives can
        be understood in two different ways, one being that computers are bringing changes to the way we perceive and
        process data. On the other hand, the development of technology has brought us experiences from the Internet to
        touch screens and interactive video games.
        <br> <br>
        My work "Yume no Hana" is derived from the Japanese pronunciation of "Dream flower". This is my first attempt
        and exposure to generative art, to think in a different way to form art. Compared to previous forms of art, this
        time it was more like I made the rules and then the computer generated the work according to the rules I
        specified.
